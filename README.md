# 2. What is Obsidian?
**The human brain is non-linear: we jump from idea to idea, all the time. Your second brain should work the same.**

**In Obsidian, making and following connections is frictionless. Tend to your notes like a gardener; at the end of the day, sit back and marvel at your own knowledge graph.**

# 2. Description
The project *OB_Templates* is an <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> template repository.

Since the start of the project, there have been many changes. Since the beginning, it is a gathering place for all my templates. Soon after, it became a project aimed at onboarding new users to <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> - with a very important rule. **All templates must use only the core plugins of Obsidian**

In time, I found that the plugin <a href="https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview">DataView</a> became an essential tool for every user. I do try to keep the project as basic as possible, so as to not confuse new users.

All the available templates are not designed to be perfect. They are intended to be used as a reference for any user to build on them, or to inspire when building new templates.

# 3. Usage
*OB_Templates* is not a vault template, this is simply a folder of templates to be added in your vault. 

You can add the templates to your vault in different ways, these are some of my easiest examples.

1. Download the repository, extract the files and add to your vault.
2. Go to a specific template and copy the text (Make sure you open in raw mode) and copy the text to a file in your vault.
