## Contents
### 1. What is Obsidian?
**The human brain is non-linear: we jump from idea to idea, all the time. Your second brain should work the same.**

In Obsidian, the making and following of connections is frictionless. **Tend to your notes like a gardener;** at the end of the day, sit back and marvel at your own knowledge graph.

### 2. Why?
Since the start of the project, there have been many changes; at first, it was a gathering place for templates. Soon after, it became a project aimed at onboarding new users to <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> - with a very important rule. **All templates must use only the core plugins of Obsidian**

In time, we found that the plugin <a href="https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview">DataView</a> became an essential tool for every user. **The goal of the project is to keep it as basic as possible, so as to not confuse new users.**

All the available templates are not designed to be perfect. They are intended to be used as a reference for any user to build on them, or to inspire when building new templates.
